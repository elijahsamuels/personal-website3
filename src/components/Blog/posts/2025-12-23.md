When I worked at Charter Communications on the Wi-Fi Captive Portal team, I got exposure to nearly every layer of the OSI model. At Layer 7 (Application), we developed the frontend with React, backend with NodeJS, and managed data in AuroraDB (PostgreSQL), orchestrated through GitLab CI/CD. Layer 4 (Transport) was involved whenever TCP or UDP connections carried portal pages and  authentication requests.

User session management, such as expiring Wi-Fi trials, was implemented at the application level, aligning with Layer 5 (Session) concepts. We collaborated with network engineers to track packets and diagnose routing issues using traceroute and Wireshark, which gave visibility into Layer 3 (Network) activity.

At Layer 2 (Data Link), we ensured SSIDs were broadcasting correctly from routers and occasionally configured MAC addresses. Finally, at Layer 1 (Physical), we set up and tested equipment including routers, cabling, and Wi-Fi radios via our home test equipment. Even brief exposure at each layer gave me a comprehensive perspective on how application logic, transport protocols, and physical networking all interact to deliver a seamless user experience.

It was also during this time that I got to spend time creating some sequence diagrams using UML (universal modeling language). I remember at first really disliking UML too, because it felt incredibly delicate and anything wrong would crash the render. I've grown to really like it and actually enjoy doing diagrams as part of documentation.

I imagine most people have various devices connected to their home network. I'm not much different, but at a point, as more and more devices got added, it became tricky to remember which device was on what address. Not all devices need a static address, but some require it. I realized I had the tool to help map out the network to help keep track of everything. In the below diagram, I've masked IP address and MAC addresses. Super helpful, and was a fun little project to put this diagram together.
