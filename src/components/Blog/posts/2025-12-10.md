#### My experience at DefCon 33

My lovely wife had the idea/inspiration to attend DefCon 33 in Las Vegas. While I think she wanted to do this more for me, I know she also wanted to attend the Social Engineering Village. To be honest, I was a little apprehensive only because I thought everyone and everything would be far beyond my level. I was wrong, not entirely wrong.

First thing to note is that there is a lot. Truly a lot. Lots of people, lots of talks/presentations, CTF/competitions/contents/challenges, booths, stickers, walking. Not a lot sleep. Lots of information, and a lot I didn't know, but somethings I was very comfortable with. You have to pick an choose the things you want to participate in. The [Hacker Tracker](https://hackertracker.app/) app is you guide and map (literally) to all the things.
- Bring good shoes. You'll walk a lot, and stand in lines a lot.
- Bring snacks. Lines are long, you'll be running from one end of the LVCC to the other.
- Bring a light weight laptop.
- Don't worry about the heat: you're inside. LVCC has A/C.
- Bring a hotspot/pocket wifi. DEFCON and LVCC setup fast internet, but there's only so much bandwidth for ~30k people.

Second, for the [workshops](https://defcon.outel.org/dcwp/dc33/activities/workshops/) you want to attend, jump on that schedule. Spots are limited and once those are opened for booking, they fill up fast. However, depending on how many people are already signed up, you *might* be able to do a 'walk in'. I feel super fortunate and lucky to have been able to do this for the ['Hands-On Threat Hunting with Wireshark' hosted bt Chris Greer](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-33/dc-33-workshops.html#content_60697). I had seen some of [Chris' videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/chrisgreer), and really wanted to see this workshop. If you ever have a chance to learn from Chris, do it. He's a great educator and incredibly knowledgable. This workshop was a highlight of DefCon for me.

These workshops are about 4 hours. Be the professional adult you are: go the bathroom before hand, bring water and a snack to get you through this. 

Third, participate. The [villages](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-33/dc-33-villages.html) have free trainings and labs to do. They also host competitions/contests, and there are TONS of competitions/contests. Prizes include a badge to the conference, 3d printers, money or something else!

My wife wanted to participate in the Phish Stories competition, and asked if I would do it with her. I personally don't really enjoy writing, and so I was a bit reluctant to doing this. I had been giving the requirements a bit of thought, but wrote nothing down until the morning it was due. I wrote out a story, presented a simple technique (one I had used in high school as a short live prank to a friend), and sent it off. I didn't think anything of it and figured everyone else would win. I guess I presented a good enough scenario and won the Wizard award. **Thank you Serum!**

Finally, if you haven't gone, check out the previous years content. DEFCON hosts their media server where you dig through their archives. Not everything will be there, but there's still plenty. You can also find recordings on the [DEFCONConference YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@DEFCONConference). So if you can't make a presentation, make a note of it and look for it later.
