#### Problem:
- Self host technical blog posts to include code examples.
- Use markdown language to display code examples with syntax highlighting and keep styling relatively simple.

#### Solution: 
- Use markdown code blocks within React components to display code examples with syntax highlighting.

I personally really like using markdown for writing documentation, and wanted to use it for my blog posts. The idea of hosting blog articles via another service that ultimately paywalls for content they didn't create bothers me. 

The below examples are just a few tests using markdown within React to display code examples.

Here's a bash example:
```bash
# Bash Comment
npm install example-package
```
---
Here's a CSS example:
```css
/* CSS Comment */
.example-class {
	background-color: red;
	color: white;
}
```
---
Here's an HTML example:
```html
<!-- HTML Comment -->
	<h1>Example heading</h1>
	<div>Example HTML</div>
	<p>Example paragraph</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Example list item</li>
		<li>Example list item</li>
		<li>Another example list item</li>
	</ul>
```

Here's a JavaScript example:

```javascript
// JavaScript Comment
import axios from 'axios';

const fetchPost = async () => {
  const response = await axios.get('https://example.com/posts');
  console.log(response.data);
};

await fetchPost();
```
---
Here's a Python example:

```python
# Python Comment
def fetch_post():
  try:
    response = requests.get('https://example.com/posts')
    response.raise_for_status() 
    data = response.json()
    
  except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

fetch_post()
```
