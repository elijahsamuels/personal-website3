- Question: What is it? Why/how do I use it?


##### What is a JWT?

At its simplest, a JWT (pronounced "jot") is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. Because it is digitally signed, the information can be verified and trusted. In a project, you use a secret key on the server to sign these tokens, ensuring that if a user tries to forge their JWT, the server catches it instantly.

---

##### The Anatomy of a Token

A JWT is composed of three parts separated by dots (`.`):

1. **Header:** The type of token and the signing algorithm (like HMAC SHA256).
2. **Payload:** The "claims." Pretty much any value can be stored here, like the `id`, `email`, `roles`, etc. You can write your own key/values, but there is some common Registered Claims to be aware of. I have a [table listed below](#registered-claims). There are more, and this is just to provide a start.
3. **Signature:** The hash used to verify the sender is who they say they are.

##### Why Use It?

* **Statelessness:** The server doesn't need to query a "sessions" table in a database for every single request. The token *is* the proof of identity. This saves precious RAM and CPU cycles on our Pi.
* **Cross-Domain Ease:** JWTs make it easy to pass identity to the frontend (or any connection) without complex cookie-sharing configurations.
* **Scalability:** JWTs allow us to spin up multiple instances of the API without worrying about "sticky sessions" or a centralized session store like Redis.

---

##### 1. The Issuer

When a user logs into the frontend, the server validates their credentials against the database. If they match, we use `jsonwebtoken` to sign a payload:

```javascript
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';

const token = jwt.sign(
  { userId: user.id, role: 'admin' }, 
  process.env.JWT_SECRET, 
  { expiresIn: '1h' }
);

```

##### 2. The Storage

On the frontend, we receive this token. For the frontend, we typically store this in memory or a secure cookie. When making calls via **Axios**, we attach it to the `Authorization` header:

```javascript
// Axios Interceptor for server requests
axios.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${token}`;

```

##### 3. The Validation (Middleware)

The server uses **Passport.js** (specifically `passport-jwt`) to guard routes. If the signature is invalid or the token is expired, the request is bounced with a `401 Unauthorized` before it ever hits our business logic.

---

##### A Note on Security

JWTs are powerful, but they aren't magic.

* **Don't store sensitive data:** Since the payload is Base64Url encoded (not encrypted), **anyone** who intercepts the token can read it. Never put sensitive data in a JWT. EVER. Here's an example why. Copy the JWT below, and paste into [jwt.io](https://www.jwt.io/)

```jwt
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6IjFhMmIzYyIsIm5hbWUiOiJFbGlqYWggU2FtdWVscyIsImVtYWlsIjoiZWxpamFoc2FtdWVsc0BnbWFpbC5jb20iLCJyb2xlIjoiYWRtaW4iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDA3NzYwMzcsImV4cCI6MTc0MDc4MzIzN30.R_6XW-p6G6P9pX5fQ9J7V8-x6H6P9pX5fQ9J7V8-x6H
```

You should see the decoded base64 text:

```json
{
  "id": "1a2b3c",
  "name": "Elijah Samuels",
  "email": "elijahsamuels@gmail.com",
  "role": "admin",
  "iat": 1740776037,
  "exp": 1740783237
}
```

If you wanted to edit the JWT, try it out at [token.dev](https://token.dev/)
Presuming things are configured correctly on your project, when you pass an edited JWT, your authorization service *should* fail the request because the signing key is now altered and won't match against the server.


Nothing tricky. Nothing hidden. Very easy to access, and that's why you never put sensitive information in a JWT.

##### Final Thought

JWTs turn authentication into a portable, lightweight data packet. For a distributed system, it’s not just a choice—it’s the standard.

##### Registered Claims 

| Claim | Full Name | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| iss | Issuer | Identifies who created the token. |
| sub | Subject | The unique identifier for the user. This matches the id from the database. |
| aud | Audience | Identifies the intended recipients. You might set this to the name of your frontend to ensure a token meant for the dashboard isn't used elsewhere. |
| exp | Expiration Time | The exact Unix timestamp when the token becomes invalid. |
| nbf | Not Before | The time before which the JWT must not be accepted. Useful if you're issuing tokens for a future scheduled event. |
| iat | Issued At | The time the token was generated. Used to determine the "age" of a session. |
| jti | JWT ID | A unique string for the token itself. Useful for "token blacklisting" if you need to revoke a specific JWT before it expires. |
